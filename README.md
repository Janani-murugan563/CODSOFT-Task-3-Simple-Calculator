🙋‍♀️ About Me I'm Janani, a passionate AI & Data Science student at Rajalakshmi Institute of Technology. I love building tools that combine practical logic with aesthetic design — and this project reflects that blend. You’ll find me working on Python projects, refining UIs, and sharing knowledge with the tech community.
